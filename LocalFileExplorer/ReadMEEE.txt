What is this:

file explorer that shows the first image of each folder.
Only the tree view on the left side can be used to navigate! Clicking on the image will open the corresponding folder. Or u can enter ur directory manually, too.
Rendered image size is controlled by the slider at the top-right to save memory, hitting RefreshView button will rerender the image if it's too blurry.
Larger folder will take some time to load so don't worry about it being forzen.
You can set up ur favorites folder in Favorites.txt and access ur favorite folders in the combobox at the topright!


how2use Favorites.txt

just look at it, it shows some pattern, dont add any empty lines in the middle.
my program reads it two lines each time.
if the bundled Favorites.txt disappeared for some reason, it will recreate a blank file, just fill it urself, remember, it splits with '|'.
At the end, add ONE new line. (CRLF)
example:
Name|Fav1
Path|D:\Picture
whateverthenameis|Fav23424
WhatThePath|V:\Pictures\FUCK
