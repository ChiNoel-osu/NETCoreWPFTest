# NETCoreWPFTest
HELP THS IS SO HARD

Contains my stupid GUI projects using C# .NET Core 3.1.


For the time being:

AiCDebugHelper folder contains a little program that reads the debug file of the game Alice in Cradle to provide a better UI for value changing. Everything is hardcoded. I need to learn MVVM and stuffs, help.

LocalFileExplorer just shows folder but as the first image of that folder.
